## Datasets for potential class projects
My repo with all data sets can be found [here](https://github.com/cachu28/up206-carolyn/tree/main/data)

### Traffic Collision Data from 2010 to Present
Description: This dataset reflects traffic collision incidents in the City of Los Angeles. The data are transcribed from original traffic reports from LAPD. 

I'm interested in comparing recent traffic collision data to traffic flows and traffic deaths during the pandemic. The LA Times just published [this article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-09/traffic-deaths-vision-zero-garcetti) about rising fatalities and injuries caused by motorists. I would be interested in exploring the data behind this article further.

### High Injury Network
Description: The High Injury Network represents 6% of Los Angeles' total street mileage but represents 65% of all deaths and severe injuries involving pedestrians. The data are from the lastest 5 years of traffic collision data.

Similar to what I described above under the traffic collision data, I would be interested in learning more about data that informs transportation policy.

### Airbnb Listings in LA County
Description: This CSV file contains detailed listings for 32,864 Airbnb listings in Los Angeles County. Each entry includes information about listing, including the host's publicly available information, city or neighborhood, type (entire homes, private room, etc), and availability. We can also look at hosts who have multiple listings for separate rooms in the same apartment or multiple apartments and homes.

This dataset can be used to compare the price of Airbnb listings to rent costs of comparable units across (a few) neighborhoods in Los Angeles. I think this would produce interesting descriptive data about the range in hosuing costs in the area. I would be also be interested to see how these costs have changed over time.
