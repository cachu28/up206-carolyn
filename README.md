## Introduction
My name is Carolyn Chu (she, her). I'm a second year MURP in the Design & Development concentration. I have a wide set of interests in urban planning, including public space (who gets to use them/who doesn't?), climate change (how are our cities preparing for climate disasters), and...

## My Mapping Experience
I'm looking forward to learning more about spatial data science and mapping. I've taken two previous GIS courses at UCLA, one through the Geography Department and the other through the Urban Planning Department. Here are some maps that I've made in the past using QGIS and ArcMap.

## Description of the Course
Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective. The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. 

## My Objectives
While in this class, I hope to...

## Project Ideas
Here are some project ideas that I've come up with for this course.
