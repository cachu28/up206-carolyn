## Introduction :dodo:
My name is Carolyn Chu (she, her). I'm a second year MURP student in the Design & Development concentration. I have a wide set of interests in the field of urban planning, including the study of public space, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and how the built environment affects personal and public health. I'm looking forward to learning more from this class and my peers about spatial data science and mapping!

## Description of the Course :earth_asia:
The goal of this course is to expose students to the foundations of spatial data science. Students will begin with an introduction to various data science tools and the basics of Python. Then students will conduct spatial analysis through Python libraries and advanced geoprocessing. Students will be using "real" data to analyze relevant and contemporary urban problems.

From our [class syllabus](https://github.com/yohman/22W-UP206A):
>Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective.

## My Objectives :clipboard:
While in this course, I hope to:
- learn how to critically evaluate and visualize data
- apply data science techniques to produce compelling maps and graphics
- maintain a positive attitude about coding and remote learning

## Project Ideas :pencil2:
Here are some project ideas for the group project:
- Comparing affordable housing sites and travel time to work to explore the relationship of affordable housing sites to job access
- Airbnb rental locations/prices and their effects on an area's rent changes
- How travel patterns and traffic deaths have changed during COVID-19
